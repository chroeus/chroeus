I'm a 16 y/o builder & entrepreneur I am presently working as a freelancer,blogger, entrepreneur & software developer. I'm currently training students from the age of 12-20 for professional career. I'm also training students from the age of 6-21 for coding with making a customised roadmap for each one of them based on their grasping ability,critical thinking, innovative skills & problem solving<br>

Around summer of 2017 I opened the first code editor of my life VS CODE not being experienced in technologies I learnt  programming through different resources that I found online one of the first languages I learnt was Javascript I found it particularly interesting and it piqued my interest because of the use case of it. Then I went on to learn a few more programming languages and frameworks currently I'm a web developer, app developer and an intermediate python developer. I'm soon hoping to learn DS & Algorithms alongside with artificial intelligence and machine learning(since I'm already intermediate in python)<br>

Recently after the lockdown I have worked with a few companies and non profits and helped them develop a unique user base and value proposition that would really pique the interest of users to comment on that product and give valuable feedback<br>
